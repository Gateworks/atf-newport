Currently we have three levels of code:
- Common
- Family
- Platform

Additionaly we have drivers which resides in:
/drivers/marvell/octeontx

Common code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx

We have two families CN8xxx and CN9xxx.
CN8xxx code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx

CN9xxx code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx

We have four platforms: T81, T83, F95 and T96.
T81 code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx/t81

T83 code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx/t83

F95 code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx2/f95

T96 code reside in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/otx2/t96

Common code may call:
- functions implemented in common code
- functions defined in headers at common level
Common code may include:
- header at common level
- header from family and platform levels only if it not contains functions
  definitions (e.g. platform_def.h). This header has to be defined for all families/platforms.

Family code may call:
- functions implemented in family level
- funcitons defined in headers at family level
Family code may include:
- header at family level
- header from platform level only if it not contains functions definitions
  (e.g. platform_def.h). This header has to be defined for all platforms that are
  part of this family.
- header from common level only in file which provide implementation of functions
  from that header.

Platform code may call:
- functions implemented in platform level
Platform code may include:
- header at platform level
- header from common or family level only in file which provide implementation of
  functions from that header.

Because of common API new platform need to have:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/{family}/{new_plat}/include/platform_def.h
/plat/marvell/octeontx/{family}/{new_plat}/include/platform_irqs_def.h
/plat/marvell/octeontx/{family}/{new_plat}/include/platform_scfg.h
/plat/marvell/octeontx/{family}/{new_plat}/include/platform_svc.h
New platform needs to implement functions from:
/include/plat/marvell/octeontx/octeontx_plat.h
/include/plats/marvell/octeontx/octeontx_plat_configuration.h
/include/plat/marvell/octeontx/octeontx_common.h
If any of this functions is not implemented at family level, it will be implemented in:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/{family}/{new_plat}/plat_{new_plat}_setup.c

New platform needs to implement ecam_platform_defs plat_ops in following file:
/plat/marvell/octeontx/{family}/{new_plat}/plat_{new_plat}_ecam.c

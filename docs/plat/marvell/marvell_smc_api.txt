SMC interface
=============

This document purpose is to describe Marvell-specific SMC runtime services, which
creates runtime interface for non-secure firmware/OS. Describing standard ARM
PSCI services is out of the scope of this paper. More information about these
can be found at [PSCI]. To read more about SMCs, there is specification called
[SMC Calling Convention][SMCCC].


Version 1.0
-----------
As for version 1.0, following Marvell's services are available:

1. OCTEONTX_SVC_CALL_COUNT

  * SMC_FID: 0xc200ff00
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
  * Return value (x0):
    - Number of implemented Service Calls
  * Description:
    This call returns number of currently implemented Marvell's runtime services.
  * Supported platforms: T81, T83, F95, T96

2. OCTEONTX_SVC_UID

  * SMC FID: 0xc200ff01
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
  * Return value (x0):
    - Marvell OEM Service UUID
  * Description:
    This call returns Marvell OEM Service UUID
  * Supported platforms: T81, T83, F95, T96

3. OCTEONTX_SVC_VERSION

  * SMC FID: 0xc200ff03
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
  * Return value:
    - x0: SMC version 32-bit major number
    - x1: SMC version 32-bit minor number
  * Description:
    This call returns major and minor version numbers of current Marvell runtime
    services implementation. Different major revision values indicates possibly
    incompatible SMC APIs. For two revisions, A and B, for which the major
    revision values are identical, if the minor revision value of revision B is
    greater than the minor revision value of revision A, then every SMC in the
    affected range that works in revision A must also work in revision B.
    Major revision number is incremented when:
    * Any SMC call is removed
    * Updates which aren't backward compatible are made
    Minor revision number is incremented when:
    * Any SMC call is added
    * Backwards compatible changes are made to existing function arguments
  * Supported platforms: T81, T83, F95, T96

4. OCTEONTX_DRAM_SIZE

  * SMC FID: 0xc2000301
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
    - x1: Number of NUMA node to check size of DRAM
  * Return value (x0):
    - Return size of DRAM in bytes
  * Description:
    This call returns size of DRAM in bytes for specified by caller NUMA node.
  * Supported platforms: T81, T83, F95, T96

5. OCTEONTX_NODE_COUNT

  * SMC FID: 0xc2000601
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
  * Return value (x0):
    - Number of NUMA nodes available in system
  * Description:
    This call returns number of NUMA nodes in system.
  * Supported platforms: T81, T83, F95, T96

6. OCTEONTX_INSTALL_GPIO_INT

  * SMC FID: 0xc2000801
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
    - x1: gpio number
    - x2: stack pointer
    - x3: cpu
    - x4: isr handler address
  * Return value (x0):
    - Non-zero value indicates that interrupt cannot be installed
  * Description:
    This call allows to enable interrupt for specified gpio number that will be
    handled on selected cpu. Isr handler address is user space handler called on
    interrupt. The handler will use specified stack pointer. In x0 register
    the gpio number will be passed to the handler.
  * Supported platforms: T83, F95, T96

7. OCTEONTX_REMOVE_GPIO_INT

  * SMC FID: 0xc2000802
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
    - x1: gpio number
  * Return value (x0):
    - Always zero
  * Description:
    This call allows to disable interrupt on specified gpio number that was
    previously setup by OCTEONTX_INSTALL_GPIO_INT SMC.
  * Supported platforms: T83, F95, T96

8. OCTEONTX_PUTC

  * SMC FID: 0xc2000a01
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
    - x1: character to print
  * Return value: N/A
  * Description:
    This call allows to put single character on console. It's especially useful
    for debug purposes.
  * Supported platforms: T81, T83, F95, T96

9. OCTEONTX_DISABLE_RVU_LFS

  * SMC FID: 0xc2000b01
  * Input registers values:
    - x0: SMC_FID
    - x1: node number
  * Return value (x0):
    - Always zero
  * Description:
    This call can be used to disable NPA/NIX LFs to PFs mapping configured by
    ARM-TF. Node number is for scalability with future octeontx2 SoC revisions.
  * Supported platforms: F95, T96

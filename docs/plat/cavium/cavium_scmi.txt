CAVIUM
======

ARM Trusted Firmware SCMI implementation
=====================================

Purpose of this document is to describe the ATF's SCMI generic driver port
to plat/cavium directory.

This file does not contain any information about System Control
and Management Interface (SCMI) - for more information about SCMI,
reader is obliged to get familiar with SCMI spec available at
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0056a/DEN0056A_System_Control_and_Management_Interface.pdf


Overview
-----------------

CPC cluster (SCP/MCP) present on CN9xxx series is responsible for Power
Management (which includes the shutdown/suspend/power/hotplug on given AP core)
and System Power Management (which includes the shutdown/suspend/power
on whole system).

On CN8xxx series, the PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface) handlers
in ATF were responsible for the above tasks. On CN9xxx series, PSCI handlers
are attached to SCMI (which sends a request to CPC for required action).


ATF<->SCP communication
-----------------

Current implementation assumes that ATF communicates only with SCP (System Control
Processor) from the CPC cluster. There's no runtime communication between ATF and MCP.

ATF communicates with SCP over dedicated mailboxes, which configuration contains:
 - mailbox base address

   This address is received from CN9xxx platform by calling method:

   const uintptr_t plat_get_scmi_mbox_addr(int node)

   for CN93xx, it returns the CPC_RAM_MEMX(0x58000).
   The size of the mailbox used by ATF is 16KB.


 - doorbell base address

   This address is received from CN9xxx platform by calling method:

   const uintptr_t plat_get_scmi_db_addr(int node)

   for CN93xx, it returns the XCPX_DEVX_XCP_MBOX(0, 0),
   First 0 is to indicate SCP, second to indicate doorbell register
   (CAVM_XCP_MBOX_DEV_E_AP_SECURE0).


 - doorbell preserve mask

   This address is received from CN9xxx platform by define (in platform_setup header):

   PLAT_SCMI_DB_PRESERVE_MASK


 - doorbell modify mask

   This address is received from CN9xxx platform by define (in platform_setup header):

   PLAT_SCMI_DB_MODIFY_MASK


Required mappings
-----------------

Due to required write permissions to mailbox and doorbell regions,
Cavium ATF maps the following memory regions:
 - CPC_RAM_MEMX with size based on CAVM_CPC_CONST memory regions
 - XCP_PF_BAR0 with size of XCP_PF_BAR0_SIZE
